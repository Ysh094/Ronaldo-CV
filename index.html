            <p>
              A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing
              as well as through the centre of the pitch and, while ostensibly
              right-footed, is very strong with both feet. Tactically, Ronaldo
              has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at
              Sporting and during his first season at
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_United_F.C."
                >Manchester United</a
              >, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right
              side of midfield, where he regularly looked to deliver crosses
              into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his
              pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on
              opponents in one-on-one situations.
